## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a hybrid system combining fuzzy logic and large language
models (LLMs) for managing IoT devices through natural language rules. The
system uses fuzzy logic as a **semantic bridge** between raw numerical sensor
values and linguistic concepts that an LLM can understand and process for
decision-making and device control.

**Primary Language:** Python

**Target Environment:** Resource-constrained edge devices with limited or no
internet connectivity

**Authoritative Source:** This document derives from and implements the thesis
assignment defined in [thesis-setup.md](thesis-setup.md)

### 2.1 Thesis Prototype Scope (MVP)

The thesis prototype focuses on demonstrating the core **semantic bridge**
concept with these essential features:

- **Fuzzy Logic Processing:** JSON-configurable membership functions and
  linguistic variables transforming sensor values to qualitative descriptions
- **Offline LLM Inference:** Local execution via Ollama with models up to 7B
  parameters (Mistral, LLaMA, or equivalent)
- **Natural Language Rules:** Free-form rule input with LLM-based interpretation
- **Device Control:** MQTT-based communication with sensors and actuators
- **CLI Interface:** Command-line interface for rule management and monitoring
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker Compose orchestration for consistent
  development, testing, and deployment

### 2.2 Out of Scope (Future Work)

The following features are documented for extensibility but are **not required**
for thesis evaluation:

- Web-based user interface
- REST API for programmatic access
- Multi-protocol device support (HTTP REST, serial, CoAP)
- Distributed multi-node deployment

## 3. Project Objectives

The project delivers a functional prototype system with the following
capabilities:

1. Accept natural language control rules from non-technical users
2. Convert raw sensor data into qualitative linguistic descriptions using fuzzy
   logic as a **semantic bridge** to linguistic concepts
3. Process linguistic descriptions and rules using an offline LLM
4. Generate concrete control actions for IoT devices
5. Operate without internet connectivity while maintaining data privacy

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Fuzzy Logic Module (Semantic Bridge)

The fuzzy logic module serves as the **semantic bridge** between raw numerical
sensor data and linguistic concepts that the LLM can understand:

- Transform numerical sensor values into linguistic variables (e.g.,
  "temperature is hot", "humidity is moderate")
- Define membership functions in JSON format for dynamic configuration
- Support multiple sensor types and linguistic categories
- Enable runtime reconfiguration without system redeployment
- Provide transparent mapping between numerical and qualitative values

### 4.2 Large Language Model Component

- Utilize an offline-capable LLM (maximum 7B parameters) via Ollama
- Supported models: Mistral 7B Instruct (default), LLaMA, or equivalent
  open-source alternatives
- Optimize for resource-constrained edge device execution
- Process linguistic sensor descriptions generated by the semantic bridge
- Interpret free-form natural language rules
- Generate actionable device control commands

### 4.3 Rule Interpretation System

- Parse free-form natural language control rules as specified in the thesis
- Match linguistic conditions from the semantic bridge against rule
  specifications
- Translate LLM outputs to device-specific control actions
- Handle ambiguous or incomplete rule specifications
- Maintain rule consistency and conflict resolution

### 4.4 System Integration (Thesis Prototype)

- Implement MQTT-based communication for sensor data acquisition (via Mosquitto)
- Develop actuator control mechanisms for IoT devices via MQTT
- Create JSON-based configuration system for membership functions and linguistic
  variables
- Establish data flow pipeline: sensors → fuzzy semantic bridge → LLM →
  actuators

## 5. Deliverables

## 6. Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if it achieves the thesis objectives:

1. **Semantic bridge validation:** Accurate transformation of sensor values to
   linguistic descriptions that enable effective LLM reasoning
2. Accurate interpretation of natural language rules with minimal ambiguity
3. Response time under 5 seconds for typical IoT control scenarios
4. Successful offline operation on resource-constrained hardware
5. Demonstrated functionality in smart home automation domain
6. Positive usability feedback from non-technical users
7. Measurable advantages of the fuzzy-LLM hybrid approach over baseline methods

## 7. Technical Constraints

- Python as primary implementation language
- Offline LLM operation via Ollama (no cloud API dependencies)
- Maximum 7B parameter model size
- JSON format for all configuration data (membership functions, linguistic
  variables, device definitions)
- MQTT protocol for device communication (thesis prototype)
- Support for edge device deployment
- Privacy-preserving design (no data transmission to external services)

## 8. Expected Outcomes and Significance

This project addresses a critical gap in IoT system management by enabling
non-technical users to define complex control logic in natural language while
maintaining interpretability through the fuzzy logic **semantic bridge**. The
offline execution requirement ensures data privacy and low latency, making the
approach suitable for industrial, residential, and agricultural applications
where internet connectivity is limited or prohibited.

The hybrid architecture provides transparency in the mapping from sensor values
to linguistic concepts, allowing users to understand and debug system behavior.
This contrasts with black-box LLM approaches and inflexible traditional rule
engines. Successful implementation will demonstrate that sophisticated AI
techniques can be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices while remaining
accessible to users without programming expertise.

## 9. Risk Mitigation

**LLM Performance Limitations:** Use Ollama with multiple candidate models
(Mistral 7B, LLaMA 3.2). Implement fallback mechanisms for rule interpretation
if LLM output is ambiguous or incorrect.

**Resource Constraints:** Profile and optimize critical code paths. Use
quantized models (4-bit) for LLM deployment via Ollama. Implement caching
strategies for repeated rule evaluations.

**Rule Ambiguity:** Design prompt engineering strategies to reduce LLM output
variability. Implement validation mechanisms for generated control commands.
Provide user feedback for ambiguous rules.

**Integration Complexity:** Adopt modular layered architecture with clear
interfaces. Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests. Document API
contracts between components.
