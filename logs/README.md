# Logs Directory

This directory contains all system log files generated by the Fuzzy-LLM Hybrid
IoT Management System.

## Purpose

Centralized logging for all system operations to enable:

- Debugging and troubleshooting
- System performance monitoring
- Historical analysis of device behavior
- Rule evaluation auditing
- Compliance and traceability

## Log Files

```
logs/
├── commands.json   # Commands sent to devices with timestamps and outcomes
├── errors.json     # Error messages and exceptions with stack traces
├── rules.json      # Rule evaluation history and trigger events
├── sensors.json    # Raw sensor values and processing results
└── system.json     # System-level events (startup, shutdown, config changes)
```

## Log Format

All log files use JSON format for machine readability and easy parsing.

Example log entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-05T14:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "rule_pipeline",
  "message": "Rule climate_001 triggered",
  "context": {
    "rule_id": "climate_001",
    "sensor_state": "temperature is hot (0.85)",
    "action": "turn_on living_room_ac"
  }
}
```

## Log Configuration

Default settings (configurable via system config):

- Format: JSON structured logging
- Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

## Privacy

All logs remain local on the edge device. No log data is transmitted to external
services, ensuring privacy by design.
