# Logs Directory

This directory contains all system log files generated by the Fuzzy-LLM Hybrid
IoT Management System.

## Purpose

Centralized logging for all system operations to enable:

- Debugging and troubleshooting
- System performance monitoring
- Historical analysis of device behavior
- Rule evaluation auditing
- Compliance and traceability

## Log Categories

- `system.log` - System-level events (startup, shutdown, configuration changes)
- `commands.log` - All commands sent to devices with timestamps and outcomes
- `sensors.log` - Raw sensor values and processing results
- `errors.log` - Error messages and exceptions with stack traces
- `rules.log` - Rule evaluation history and trigger events

## Log Configuration

As specified in the system_config.json:

- Format: JSON structured logging
- Rotation: Max 100MB per file
- Retention: 30 days
- Levels:DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL (configurable)

## Log Management

- Automatic daily rotation
- Compression of rotated files after 24 hours
- Automatic deletion of files older than retention period
- Log files are included in backups

## Privacy

All logs remain local on the edge device. No log data is transmitted to external
services, ensuring privacy by design.
